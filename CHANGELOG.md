# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes are recorded here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) while it approaches a stable API.

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- terminal decision board for cheapest, fastest, and balanced profiles;
- edge-distinct top-N routing across parallel payment networks;
- same-currency rail comparison for SEPA, SEPA Instant, and SWIFT scenarios;
- metric-level fee, time, and FX provenance validation;
- auditable provenance registry and `remit sources` command;
- Python 3.11-3.13 CI, formatting checks, and package-build validation;
- contribution, security, architecture, and source-assumption documentation.

### Fixed

- rank fees in a common USD unit and account for non-negative FX spread;
- reject routes whose live hop balance cannot cover the next fee;
- preserve parallel graph edges and deterministic provider warnings;
- bound stalled quote collection without discarding healthy providers;
- calculate Mermaid intermediate balances with the routing recurrence;
- resolve `--version` from installed package metadata instead of a source-only
  `pyproject.toml` path.

### Changed

- relabel unsupported SEPA and SWIFT numeric assumptions as `ESTIMATED`;
- conservatively label Wise USD fee normalization as `ESTIMATED` while retaining
  `VERIFIED` rate and delivery provenance.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-19

- initial Wise, SEPA, and SWIFT models;
- concurrent payment graph, multi-objective routing, CLI, and Mermaid output;
- initial automated test suite and MIT license.
